# Fibonacci numbers using dynamic programming with closure function in Golang.

## Advantage
  1. Number of calls to the recursive function is reduced as a result time complexity reduced (i.e. From O(2^n) to O(n)). 
  
## Disadvantage
   1. Space complexity is more but it is insignificant as compared to the reduced time complexity.

## Note
